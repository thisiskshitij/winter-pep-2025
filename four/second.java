/*Question-2(Static vs. Instance Variables and Methods)
Scenario: A company wants to track employee information and overall company statistics.

Create an Employee class with attributes like employeeID (int), name (String), department (String), and salary (double).

Use a static variable totalEmployees to keep track of the total number of employees in the company. Increment this variable in
the constructor.
Use a static variable totalSalaryBudget to track the total salary budget of the company. Add the employee's salary to this
variable in the constructor.
Create a static method getAverageSalary() that returns the average salary of all employees.
Create an instance method raiseSalary(double percentage) that increases the employee's salary by the given percentage.
Create several Employee objects, demonstrate the use of the static variables and methods, and show how individual employees'
salaries can be modified using the instance method.

Test Example: Create 3 employees with different salaries. Check the totalEmployees, totalSalaryBudget, and getAverageSalary().
Then, give one employee a 10% raise and check the statistics again.
