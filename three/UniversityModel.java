/* Question-1(Java Class and Object)
// Scenario: A university needs a system to manage its students, courses, and instructors.

// Design a set of classes to represent this system. Consider the following:

// Student: Has attributes like studentID (unique integer), name (String), major (String), 
coursesEnrolled (a list of Course objects), and gpa (double). Include methods to enroll in a course (enrollCourse()),
 drop a course (dropCourse()), and calculate the GPA (calculateGPA()).

// Course: Has attributes like courseCode (String, e.g., "CS101"), courseName (String), credits (integer),
 instructor (an Instructor object), and enrolledStudents (a list of Student objects).
  Include methods to add a student (addStudent()) and remove a student (removeStudent()).

// Instructor: Has attributes like instructorID (unique integer), name (String),
 department (String), and coursesTaught (a list of Course objects). Include a method to assign a course (assignCourse()).
// Create at least two instances of each class, populate them with sample data,
 and demonstrate enrolling a student in a course, dropping a course, and calculating a student's GPA (you can use placeholder grades for this calculation).

// Test Example: a student named "Alice" majoring in Computer Science and enroll her in "CS101" taught by "Dr. Smith."
 Then, have her drop the course. Finally, create a student named "Bob" majoring in Math and enroll him in "MA101" taught by "Dr. Jones."*/
